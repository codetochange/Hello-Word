##Basically,
the function of this app is to add photos to a list and API link the camera to a list of users and their galleries. Just like a scavengerHunt Game.



######Thanks Apple company for providing such woderful tutorial workshop for people who are in love with building app.

######In building this app, I learned how to save the state of an app on the iphone (as opposed to using a database like I used in my Firebase App).
